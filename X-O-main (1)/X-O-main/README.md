Tic-tac-toe

##
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. 
Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is often played by young children who may not have 
discovered the optimal strategy.
